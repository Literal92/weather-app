# Weather Application

This is a weather application built using Angular, RxJS, and NgRx. It integrates with a weather API of your choice to fetch weather data and provides various features such as displaying weather data, search functionality, error handling, state management with NgRx, unit testing, performance optimization, and internationalization and localization support.

## Features

### Weather API Integration

- Integrate with a weather API of your choice (e.g., OpenWeather) to fetch weather data.
- Use RxJS Observables and operators to handle asynchronous data fetching.
- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API requests and improve performance.
- Support offline functionality by caching previously fetched weather data.

### Display Weather Data

- Display the current weather information, including temperature, humidity, and weather condition.

### Search Functionality

- Allow users to search for weather information by city name.
- Implement an input field with a search button.
- Fetch and display the weather data for the searched city.

### Error Handling and Logging

- Handle errors that may occur during API requests.
- Display appropriate error messages to the user.
- Integrate a logging service (e.g., Sentry) to log errors and exceptions.

### State Management with NgRx

- Use NgRx to manage the application state.
- Define actions, reducers, and effects to handle fetching weather data and updating the state accordingly.
- Use selectors to retrieve specific weather data from the state.

### Unit Testing and Test Coverage

- Write unit tests using Angular's testing frameworks (e.g., Jasmine, Karma).
- Aim for a high level of test coverage to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

### Performance Optimization

- Optimize the application's performance by lazy-loading modules, using code splitting, and optimizing network requests.
- Implement memoization techniques to cache expensive calculations and computations.

### Internationalization and Localization

- Implement internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) support to provide multi-language support in the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the weather application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   

2. Install the dependencies:
   
   cd weather-app
   npm install
   

3. Configure the weather API:
   - Sign up for an API key from your chosen weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeather).
   - Update the API key in the application's configuration file.

4. Start the development server:
   
   ng serve
   

5. Open the application in your browser:
   
   http://localhost:4200
   

## Testing

To run the unit tests and check the test coverage, use the following command:
ng test --code-coverage


This will generate a coverage report that you can view in your browser.
